These atmosphere models have been widely used since their release as they cover a wide range of stellar parameters and provide good fits to observed spectra of hotter stars (see, e.g., Bertone et al. (2004)). Other atmospheres like PHOENIX and MARCS may be preferred for lower temperature stars (for example, Chen et al.

When considering the solar chemical mixture, it is important to note that there is a difference between photospheric abundances and protostellar abundances as metals diffuse out of the photosphere over time, leading the photospheric abundances to be lower than protostellar abundances. We differentiate between these in our API. Generally the protostellar quantities (i.e., X, Y, Z) are preferred for most use cases, as these are the initial conditions for the stellar models set by the researchers and are therefore static. The diffusive processes responsible for the difference between the photospheric and protostellar metallicities depend on the initial mass of a star in addition to its age, and so a population of stars that share a single protostellar metallicity will not all have identical photospheric metallicities, even if they all have the same age. Ideally the photospheric metallicity should be a quantity tracked during the simulation of a stellar model so that it would be included in the stellar track – the photospheric metallicities are therefore a prediction of the stellar evolution models, rather than an intrinsic property set at the beginning of the simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#BolometricCorrections.AbstractChemicalMixture","page":"API Reference","title":"BolometricCorrections.AbstractChemicalMixture","text":"AbstractChemicalMixture is the abstract supertype for information regarding the chemical mixtures available or assumed for a particular grid of bolometric corrections.
