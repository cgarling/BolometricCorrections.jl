When considering the solar chemical mixture, it is important to note that there is a difference between photospheric abundances and protostellar abundances as metals diffuse out of the photosphere over time, leading the photospheric abundances to be lower than protostellar abundances. We differentiate between these in our API. Generally the protostellar quantities (i.e., X, Y, Z) are preferred for most use cases, as these are the initial conditions for the stellar models set by the researchers and are therefore static. The diffusive processes responsible for the difference between the photospheric and protostellar metallicities depend on the initial mass of a star in addition to its age, and so a population of stars that share a single protostellar metallicity will not all have identical photospheric metallicities, even if they all have the same age. Ideally the photospheric metallicity should be a quantity tracked during the simulation of a stellar model so that it would be included in the stellar track – the photospheric metallicities are therefore a prediction of the stellar evolution models, rather than an intrinsic property set at the beginning of the simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#BolometricCorrections.AbstractChemicalMixture","page":"API Reference","title":"BolometricCorrections.AbstractChemicalMixture","text":"AbstractChemicalMixture is the abstract supertype for information regarding the chemical mixtures available or assumed for a particular grid of bolometric corrections.

To use these grids, we must be able to calculate stellar mass loss rates from a star's other parameters as mass-loss rates are not typically tracked self-consistently in stellar interior models. Most implementations employ scaling relations between the mass-loss rate and parameters like the stellar metallicity and luminosity for radiation-driven winds typical in high-mass O and B stars. For example, PARSEC uses multiple different scaling relations to determine the stellar mass-loss rate depending on the phase of stellar evolution, including Vink et al.

Some grids will additionally add interstellar reddening (usually quantified by V-band extinction A_V) and/or offer other chemical compositions beyond solar-scaled chemical mixtures (typically α-enhanced or α-depleted mixtures). Grids of BCs typically differ in their coverage of these dependent variables and the synthetic spectra / stellar atmospheres they use to calculate the BCs. It is therefore useful to have access to several different libraries of BCs so that researchers can quantify how their analyses are affected by the choice of BC library. These types of investigations are what we hope to facilitate with this package.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Photometric-Zeropoints","page":"Overview","title":"Photometric Zeropoints","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"The normalization of the bolometric corrections as defined above relies on the measurement of the solar luminosity.
