  abstract  = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within
that basis to construct stellar isochrones. This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar
objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling
sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation
between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with
convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks
in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that
implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage},

  abstract = {We provide tables of theoretical isochrones in several photometric systems. To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) first, we re-write the formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in electronic form.},

  abstract = {The XXIXth IAU General Assembly in Honolulu adopted IAU 2015 Resolution B2 on recommended zero points for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. The resolution was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy after consulting with a broad spectrum of researchers from the astronomical community. Resolution B2 resolves the long-standing absence of an internationally-adopted zero point for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. Resolution B2 defines the zero point of the absolute bolometric magnitude scale such that a radiation source with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0 has luminosity L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 3.0128e28 W. The zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale (\$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0) corresponds to irradiance \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 2.518021002e-8 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The zero points were chosen so that the nominal solar luminosity (3.828e26 W) adopted by IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$(Sun) = 4.74, the value most commonly adopted in recent literature. The nominal total solar irradiance (1361 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$) adopted in IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to apparent bolometric magnitude \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bol\}\$(Sun) = -26.832. Implicit in the IAU 2015 Resolution B2 definition of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale is an exact definition for the parsec (648000/\${\textbackslash}pi\$ au) based on the IAU 2012 Resolution B2 definition of the astronomical unit.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the effects that variations in He content have on bolometric corrections and T\_eff-colour relations. To do this, we computed ATLAS9 model atmospheres and spectral energy distributions for effective temperatures ranging from 3500 K to 40 000 K for dwarfs and from 3500 K to 8000 K for giants, considering both “He-non-enhanced” and “He-enhanced” compositions. The variations in He content that were considered are of Δ Y = +0.1 and +0.2 for the metallicity [M/H] = +0.5 and Δ Y = +0.1 for [M/H] = -0.5 and -1.5. Synthetic photometry was then carried out for the UBVRIJHK system. We conclude that the changes in bolometric corrections, caused by the adopted He-enhancements are in general too small (less than 0.01 mag), for both dwarfs and giants, to be affecting present-day tables of bolometric corrections at a significant level. The only possible exceptions are found for the U-band at T\_eff between 4000 K and 8000 K, where {\textbar}Δ BCU{\textbar} amounts to {\textasciitilde}0.02 mag, and for T\_eff equal to 3500 K, where {\textbar}Δ BCS\_λ{\textbar} values clearly become much higher (up to 0.06 mag for passbands from U to V). However, even in the latter case the overall uncertainty caused by variations in the He content may be not so significant, because the ATLAS9 results are still approximative at their lowest temperature limit.},

  abstract     = {New, high-resolution MARCS synthetic spectra have been calculated for more than a dozen mixtures of the metals allowing, in turn, for variations in C:N:O, [CNO/Fe], and enhanced abundances of C, O, Mg, and Si. Bolometric corrections (BCs) for many of the broad-band filters currently in use have been generated from these spectra. Due to improved treatments of molecules that involve atoms of C, N, and O, the BCs for UV and blue passbands, in particular, differ substantially from those derived from previous MARCS models. These differences, and the effects on the BCs of varying the abundances of the metals, are shown in a number of instructive plots. Stellar evolutionary grids for -2.5 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤-0.5 have also been computed for the different mixtures. Isochrones based on these tracks are intercompared on the theoretical H-R diagram and on a few of the colour-magnitude diagrams that can be constructed from HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) F336W, F438W, F606W, F814W, F110W, and F160W observations. For the first application of these models, isochrones have been fitted to WFC3 photometry of the globular cluster NGC 6496 from the HST UV Legacy Survey, with very encouraging results.},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, the photospheric solar metallicity as determined from spectroscopy experienced a remarkable downward revision. Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a CO5BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not responsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years. The solar metallicity resulting from this analysis is Z=0.0153, Z/X=0.0209.},
