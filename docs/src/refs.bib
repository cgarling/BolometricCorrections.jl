  abstract  = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within
that basis to construct stellar isochrones. This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar
objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling
sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation
between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with
convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks
in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that
implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage},

  abstract = {We provide tables of theoretical isochrones in several photometric systems. To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) first, we re-write the formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in electronic form.},

  abstract = {The XXIXth IAU General Assembly in Honolulu adopted IAU 2015 Resolution B2 on recommended zero points for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. The resolution was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy after consulting with a broad spectrum of researchers from the astronomical community. Resolution B2 resolves the long-standing absence of an internationally-adopted zero point for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. Resolution B2 defines the zero point of the absolute bolometric magnitude scale such that a radiation source with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0 has luminosity L\$\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 3.0128e28 W. The zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale (\$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$ = 0) corresponds to irradiance \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ = 2.518021002e-8 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The zero points were chosen so that the nominal solar luminosity (3.828e26 W) adopted by IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Bol\}\$(Sun) = 4.74, the value most commonly adopted in recent literature. The nominal total solar irradiance (1361 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$) adopted in IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to apparent bolometric magnitude \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bol\}\$(Sun) = -26.832. Implicit in the IAU 2015 Resolution B2 definition of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale is an exact definition for the parsec (648000/\${\textbackslash}pi\$ au) based on the IAU 2012 Resolution B2 definition of the astronomical unit.},
